### Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation

Given the MNIST 64x64 handwritten recognition dataset, we define the following two sets as "source" and "target":

<img src="/resources/target_domain.png" alt="Target MNIST domain" height="350">
</p>

The goal is to maximize the accuracy of a classifier on the "target" set. However, **labels are only available for the "source" set**. We formulate the task as a **domain adaptation problem in adversarial terms**. Two networks, the classifier and the domain discriminator, compete to optimize opposite objectives. 

In particular, the discriminator predicts whether a sample image belongs to the "source" or the "target" domains, **accessing features from the input images through the classifier network only**. At the same time, the classifier has two simultaneous objectives: a) recognizing digits from the "source" domain in a supervised fashion, and b) **fooling the discriminator** by maximizing its classification error.

The idea behind adversarial domain adaptation is that **the classifier will eventually learn to hide features that are useful to discriminate between domains**. By doing so, it becomes robust against domain differences and improves its classification accuracy in the "target" set.

### Results

Classification accuracy:

|               | Source Set    | Target Set    | Performance Gap |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Without ADDA  | 0.99          | 0.38          | 0.61            |
| With ADDA     | 0.99          | 0.78          | 0.21            |

Using adversarial domain adaptation, the performance gap between the "source" and "target" datasets decreases by 3-folds.
